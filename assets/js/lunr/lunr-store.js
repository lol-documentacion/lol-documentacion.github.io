        "excerpt":"**    Download   Download Now   Basic parameters in command line   There are three things lolMiner needs in any case to know to start mining, namely     the algorithm to mine   the pool or solo node address to connect to   the user / wallet name to mine for   Configure the algorithm to mine   There are two ways in lolMiner how to specify the algorithm you want to mine. You need to choose one of them to start mining.   The first option is –algo (-a) followed by one of the following algorithm names                  Parameter       Algorithm                                       BEAM-I       BeamHash I                         BEAM-II       BeamHash II                         BEAM-III       BeamHash III                         C29AE       Cuckoo 29                         C29D       CuckarooD 29                         C29M       CuckarooM 29                         C30CTX       Cuckaroo 30 Cortex                         C31       Cuckatoo 31                         C32       Cuckatoo 32                         CR29-32       Cuckaroo 29-32                         CR29-40       Cuckaroo 29-40                         CR29-48       Cuckaroo 29-48                         EQUI144_5       Equihash 144/5                         EQUI192_7       Equihash 192/7                         EQUI210_9       Equihash 210/9                         ETCHASH       Etchash                         ETHASH       Ethash                         ZEL       ZelHash           Note that you always can call lolMiner --list-algos to get a list of all supported algorithms as well as the fee height. Also the list will inform you if the algorithms supports / requires the personalization option (–pers) that is required for some of the Equihash algorithms.   The 2nd way to configure lolMiner is via the parameter –coin (-c). This parameter does set more detailed settings for selected profiles and allows special functions, e.g. algorithm switchers or combination of an algorithm with the right personalization.   Available entries for –coin are:                  Parameter       Description                                       AION       Selecting Equihash 210/9 and right settings to mine Aion                         AUTO144_5       Mine Equihash 144/5 and allow the pool to select the personalization                         AUTO192_7       Mine Equihash 192/7 and allow the pool to select the personalization                         BEAM       Mine Beam and switch algorithm on Beam Hash II / III fork height                         BTCZ       Mine Equihash 144/5 with personalization for BitcoinZ                         BTG       Mine Equihash 144/5 with personalization for Bitcoin Gold                         ETC       Select settings &amp; stratum to mine Ethereum Classic                         ETH       Select settings  &amp; stratum to mine Ethereum                         CTXC       Select settings &amp; stratum to mine Cortex Ai                         EXCC       Select settings  &amp; stratum to mine Exchange Coin                         GRIN-C29M       Select settings &amp; stratum to mine Grin C29                         GRIN-C32       Select settings &amp; stratum to mine Grin C32                         MWC-C29D       Select settings &amp; stratum to mine MWC C29                         MWC-C31       Select settings &amp; stratum to mine MWC C31                         XSG       Mine Equihash 144/5 with personalization for Snow Gem                         YEC       Mine Equihash 192/7 with personalization for YCash                         ZCL       Mine Equihash 192/7 with personalization for Zclassic                         ZEL       Mine Zelhash &amp; stratum to mine FLUX (ZEL)                         ZER       Mine Equihash 192/7 with personalization for Zero           Note that you always can call lolMiner --list-coins to get a list of all supported coin configurations as well as the fee height.   Give the pool address, port and user name / wallet to mine on.   The parameter to select the mining pool to connect to is given by –pool. Note that this option takes the address as well as the port in the format &lt;pool address&gt;:&lt;pool port&gt;.   The user name or wallet will be passed with the parameter –user. In case you pool requires a password to log in you can add the optional parameter –pass.   To configure fail-over pools the options –pool –user and –pass can be passed multiple times to the miner. They will be processed in order, so the first occurrence belongs to the primary connection, the second to the first fail-over and so on. When the miner looses connection to the primary pool too often (5 times in a short period of time), it will try to connect with the second set of credentials.

        "title": "lolMiner&#58; changelog",
        "excerpt":"**    Recent Changelog   lolMiner 1.28a      Significantly improved / speed up DAG repair function. The miner now should produce a valid DAG also at high overclock.   Emergency temperature stop (–tmode, –tstart, –stop) now also working for Nvidia GPUs using CUDA.   Fixes      Zombie mode GPUs no longer crash during DAG verify.   When one Nvidia GPU stops because of a recoverable error (e.g. not enough memory for DAG or temperature limit reached), this will no longer crash all other Nvidia GPUs.   The parameter –disable-dag-verify was not working for OpenCL fired cards. Not it does.   Fixed overzealous reconnection on Ethash connections when not receiving new work within 30 seconds (now limit is 150 seconds). This caused problems, especially on ETC+ZIL.   Fixed 3G Nvidia card not starting on ETC mining   lolMiner 1.27      Added verify routine for Ethash dag epochs 400 to 450. In case the miner will detect defect entries, the CPU will try to fix this. Mining will be paused until the repair is completed. Use –disable-dag-verify to disable the verify &amp; repair mechanism routine.   Re-worked default Ethash kernels for Pascal GPUs - improved their performance   Added Ethash kernels for Fermi and Kepler GPUs. Most of them will only work for small epoch Eth forks.   Nvidia cards on Ethash now pause when the stratum reports no current work (e.g. when connection was lost).   Added a split DAG mode for Nvidia GPUs in case that the memory allocation fails on the primary kernels. This will be a bit slower, but improve compatibility, especially for 5G GPUs. Use –mode s to force it.   Added parameter –cclk to fix the core clock of Nvidia Turing and newer GPUs without using external tools. Use a comma separated list to give different values to cards, use * to skip over cards. Needs super user or administrator privileges to work. See a detailed description here: https://github.com/Lolliedieb/lolMiner-releases/wiki/Fix-Clock-Nvidia-for-Cuda-by-lolMiner-(English)   Added new dualmode zilEx. This works like –dualmode zil but with the ability to use –dualdevices to exclude GPUs from switching to ZIL. They will continue on the secondary connection and do not switch.   Added new dualmode eth. This will allow to point different GPUs to different pools.   Added parameter –statsformat to use custom format for the bigger statistic box. The expected values are either compact or default or extended or a comma separated list of values. Use –help-format to get a list with accepted entries. The list is also documented at https://github.com/Lolliedieb/lolMiner-releases/wiki/Stats-Format-(English)   Added reading of current core and memory clocks for AMD and Nvidia GPUs   Fixes   Fixed a stratum error, that caused the “all shares stale” bug when too many reconnect attempts in a row did fail Fixed a crash on Nvidia GPUs when mixing ethproxy and Nicehash stratum modes in dualmodes. Fixed zombie tune values not applied when using json format for configuring Fixed displayed names of RX 6000 generation of cards and RTX 3060 in 460.x drivers.   Deprecation notice   This will be the last release that allows to use the Zombie-Mode in Windows. This is because the current implementation will start throwing invalid shares at some point and also going too slow to be worth using it any more. Furthermore Cuckaroo-29 with 48 cycle length - originally planned for Italocoin - got removed because of the lack of use.   lolMiner 1.26      Slightly improved performance of Ethash on Pascal / Turing &amp; Ampere GPUs (about +0.1 - 0.2 mh per card)   Further reduced internal latency in Ethash Cuda back end (less stale shares &amp; CPU load)   Added experimental Grin-C32 kernel for Radeon 6700   Fixes     Fixed a bug in Cuda back-end to crash with a segfault on Epoch change (introduced in 1.25)   Fixed a bug that Nvidia-GPUs did not start when Cuda Toolkit was not installed (It reported “No OpenCL devices found …” - which was complete nonsense)   Fixed some (rare) potential faults in Beam stratum   Windows: Fixed message about Light Cache build time was missing (introduced in 1.25)   lolMiner 1.25 goes CUDA!  Added a real Cuda back-end for better Nvidia GPU support on Ethash. Features:     Supports Maxwell to Ampere GPU generations.   Two different mining kernels. Use –mode a (faster) –mode b (better energy efficiency) to select between the two. The selection can be done per card via a comma separated list. In mixed system select ‘a’ for skipping over the AMD cards.   Both kernel modes need less energy and perform better then in 1.24a   Reduced internal latency for less stale shares   Reduced CPU load when mining with Nvidia cards   lolMiner works now without OpenCL driver installed   In case of mixed rigs AMD GPUs will use OpenCL while Nvidia cards use Cuda   ZIL cache feature fully supported (and stable)   Temperature stop &amp; Zombie mode is currently not supported   Further Changes (over 1.24a)     Added Ethash, Beam Hash III, Grin Cuckatoo 32 and Cortex kernels for RX 6700   The Ethash stratum interface will now try to run up to three attempts of reconnecting before switching the stratum mode   Bug fixes     Fixed “Warning: index out of bounds” error when switching from ETHPROXY to ETHV1 stratum mode. This might solve problems with some pools on connection loss.   Recommendations for Cuda backend     Recommendation: When using lolMiner on Nvidia cards only use “–watchdog exit” mode and run the miner in a script that will automatically restart it on closing.   For ideal efficiency fix the core clock, do not use the offset functionality. Recommended values for selected GPUs:                  GPU       Range                       2070       1000 - 1050                 2080       1110 - 1160                 3060 (1)       1070 - 1120                 3060ti       1300 - 1350                 3070       750 - 800                 3080       1010 - 1060           (1) Using Windows and Nvidia Driver 470.05 Beta   lolMiner 1.24a  lolMiner 1.22 - 1.24 are Linux only releases that targets improvements of the performance of the zombie mode in the Linux specific code. Therefore the yesterday released version 1.21 will remain the recent release for Windows. Miners that do not have a card using the zombie mode can safely ignore this update - it will behave identical to 1.21.     Added (tunable) zombie mode kernels for R9 290(x) and  R9 295 GPUs - on a popular request.   Bug Fixes     Fixed a bug, that often caused the amdgpu driver to report a VM_CONTEXT1_PROTECTION_FAULT_STATUS on startup   Fixed defect shares and wrong reported has hrate when started with fixed –zombie-tune parameters directly   Fixed a bug with Baffin (RX 450,460, 550, 560) and Tonga (R9 380(X) ) GPUs showing too high hashrate and producing invalids in 1.23 zombie mode.   Fixed a bug with ETC mining not starting up when more then two 4G GPUs  in 1.23.   Personal release notes I received quite some requests with problems about Nvidia cards and also if I can add in zombie mode kernels for 4G Nvidias and RX 5500. I need to say I tried, but there are some hurdles that prevented it. I will do better Nvidia codes in the future, but preparing it takes time.  That said the Navi cards somehow to not like to zombie tuning at all, that is why they only feature the standard zombie mode. Currently I also can not recommend mixing them into rigs where RX 4xx and 5xx cards run in zombie mode, because that seems to cause stuck systems from time to time.  Mixing with 8G cards and do normal mining seems not to be an issue though.   lolMiner 1.23  lolMiner 1.22 &amp; 1.23 are Linux only releases that targets improvements of the performance of the zombie mode in the Linux specific code. Therefore the yesterday released version 1.21 will remain the recent release for Windows. Miners that do not have a card using the zombie mode can safely ignore this update - it will behave identical to 1.21.   lolMiner 1.22  lolMiner 1.22 is a Linux only release that targets improvements of the performance of the zombie mode in the Linux specific code. Therefore the yesterday released version 1.21 will remain the recent release for Windows. Miners that do not have a card using the zombie mode can safely ignore this update - it will behave identical to 1.21.      Significantly improved the performance of zombie mode on RX 400 and RX 500 GPUs in Linux, especially for low zombie tune values between 0 and 4 and rather high epochs. Performance increases by 7-11% on epoch 393 (–4g-alloc-size 4080 on a RX 580. 4G) and 15-20% on epoch 400. Re-tuning using the auto-tune is recommended. Also this version might draw a bit more power, but with approximately same total efficiency.   lolMiner 1.21     slightly improved the performance of Linux zombie mode on Polaris GPUs on medium tune stages (needs re-tuning from previous settings)   increased range of accepted zombie tune parameter for GPUs with high interconnect bandwidth   slightly decreased GPU load of Polaris GPUs during DAG build   Added more control about handling cards that are detected to be non-working any more. Use parameter –watchdog off/exit/script to turn off any action, exit the miner with a specific exit code or to run an external script. See detail description on the 1.21 release page   Nvidia cards that experienced a OpenCL driver error (e.g. “CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES” will now also trigger the watchdog with the configured effect.   The –ethstratum parameter can now take two options separated by a ‘,’ to give different options in case the dual or split mining mode is used.   The dns resolving and the connection attempt can now timeout (after 10 seconds each) and will re-try to connect afterwards. This fixes an issue when a pool went offline and the following connection attempt takes indefinitely much time. Each timeout event contributes to the counter that will trigger switching to fail-over pools.   New option –apihost (default 0.0.0.0) which controls to which host address the api binds. Use 127.0.0.1 to restrict api access to only your computer, 0.0.0.0 is equivalent to everyone can access when rig is reachable on the used apiport. IPV6 ip addresses should be supported, but is untested.   Fixes     Fixed a issue that might cause the rig to drop to 0 hash rate on epoch changes - including changes with activated ZIL caching   Fixed the pool hash rate reporting not working correctly in dual &amp; split stratum modes   Fixed the dual stratum connection not picking up the correct worker name when –worker is used   Fixed miner not loading Ethash / Etchash kernels on Tahiti and Hawaii GPUs when using older then end 2017 drivers.

Changelog   Changes over 1.31      Beta Feature: Added RTX 3000 series semi-unlock for LHR v2 cards giving up to 30% more performance then in locked state. Use –mode LHR2 to call it (and –mode LHR1 for 3060 LHR1 cards). Also added a low power LHR mode for V2 cards (–mode LHRLP). See below for more details. Recommended drivers for LHR2 and LHRLP: 470.63.01 or 465.31 - others could be more unstable. Most tests were done in Linux. Use –lhrtune to improve either performance or stability. Read the guide for configuring here: https://github.com/Lolliedieb/lolMiner-releases/wiki/Nvidia-Mode-Switch-&amp;-LHR-Semi-Unlock (2)   Improved performance of RTX 3060 LHR v1 semi-unlock by 2-3% depending on configuration - at same low consumption!   Added detection of the “fan glitch” for RTX 3000 LHR cards. When the glitch is detected, the GPUs will leave the special LHR modes automatically.   Significantly improved Ergo performance on GCN Gen 1 GPUs (e.g. HD 7970, R9 280, R7 370)   Added Ergo kernels for Pitcairn GPUs.   New configuration scheme for Et(c)hash + Zil dual mining with dual stratum! See documentation here: https://github.com/Lolliedieb/lolMiner-releases/wiki/Dual-Mining-from-1.32. When using json configuration style use “DPOOLS” with same format as “POOLS” currently.   When a pool requests a re-connection, the miner will now do so immediately instead of waiting 1 second and no longer say the connection got “lost”.   Added support for extra nonce subscription on Ergo stratum - this will cause less reconnects on Nicehash   Fixes     Fixed an issue causing “invalid” shares on Ethash when the pool makes intensive use of variable difficulty (e.g. HiveOn, Nicehash…) (1)   Fixed an issue that might cause the epoch to update too late when doing Eth + Zil dual stratum   Fixed an issue causing too much stale or very late shares in Ergo   Fixed partially defect .bat example files   Updated complete network stack to newer libraries - for more stability.   A lot of internal re-structuring and fixes.   1.32a: Fixed –mode LHR1 not starting in unlocked state on many systems.   1.32a: Fixed 3060 LHR V1 not starting in semi-unlock when the right drivers are detected.   (1) Thanks to my Spanish mining community for letting me know and the help to track down this issue.  (2) Feel free to discuss good tuning values in the discussion section of this release page.

Better performance of LHR semi-unlock, about 70%+ on GDDR6x cards (3070 Ti &amp; 3080 (Ti) ), about 71-72%+ on GDDR6 (3060 (Ti) &amp; 3070), 81%+ on 3060 LHR V1 with the right drivers (earlier then 460.39). Recommended driver for LHR v2: 470.74 (Linux), 472.12 (Windows)   Less performance difference between low and high core clock then earlier versions   Cards are automatically detected if they are LHR   In the beginning the miner will calibrate to your exact core &amp; memory clocks. The total process takes 3-4 minutes total. Try not to change any overclock after or during calibration, else the performance might be lower then expected!   --lhrtune has now default value of auto for an automatic tuning. Results of automatic tuning will be displayed in stats after calibration is completed. Note: re-tuning of values used in 1.32a is required!   More stable displayed hashrate on Nvidia cards when mining Eth   Fixed a bug causing a non-realistic high hash rate to be displayed on LHR cards when overclocked after start   ","categories": ["download"],
